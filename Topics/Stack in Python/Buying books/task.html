<h2>Buying books</h2>

 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Alice is a booklover and regularly buys new books. Unfortunately, she doesn't have much time to read them immediately, so she always has a stack of unread books. When Alice brings a new book, she puts it on top of the previously bought unread ones. Whenever she feels like reading, she takes a book from the very top of her book stack, finishes it in one go, and puts it on the shelf with the books she's already read.</p> 
  <p>Given a sequence of Alice's actions, print out all books that she reads. Books should be printed on separate lines.</p> 
  <p>The input is as follows. The number <strong>n</strong> refers to the total number of actions. <samp>BUY book_name</samp> denotes buying a book called <samp>book_name</samp>, while <samp>READ </samp>refers to reading the book from the top of the stack.</p> 
  <p>You can assume that initially, Alice doesn't have any unread books.</p>

    Use 
   <code class="java">split(" ", 1)</code> to split the input string on the first whitespace only. This way, the book title will not be split.
